## Test Specification Document
### Introduction
This document outlines the test scenarios for the Validator module, focusing on password validation, name validation, email validation and age validation. It is designed to ensure the module meets all functional requirements and handles edge cases gracefully.

### Test Environment
- Hardware Requirements: No specific hardware requirements; tests can be run on any standard computer.
- Software Requirements: Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), internet access.
<!-- - Tools: Jest for automated testing, Postman for API testing. -->

# Test Cases

## Test Suite: Password validation

### Test Case 1.1: Successful Password Validation
- Objective: Verify that a valid password passes all validation rules.
- Input: Enter password: "ValidPass1!"
- Expected Output: The password should pass all validation checks (minimum length, includes a number, uppercase, lowercase, and special character).
  Result: "Password is valid"

### Test Case 1.2: Failed Validation - Password Too Short
- Objective: Ensure the system detects passwords that are too short.
- Input: Enter password: "Pass1!"
- Expected Output: The password should fail the length check (less than 8 characters).
  Result: "Password must be at least eight characters long"

### Test Case 1.3: Failed Validation - No Number
- Objective: Ensure the system detects passwords without a number.
- Input: Enter password: "Password!"
- Expected Output: The password should fail the check for at least one digit.
  Result: "The password must contain at least one number"

### Test Case 1.4: Failed Validation - No Uppercase Letter
- Objective: Ensure the system detects passwords without an uppercase letter.
- Input: Enter password: "password1!"
- Expected Output: The password should fail the check for at least one uppercase letter.
  Result: "The password must contain at least one uppercase letter"

### Test Case 1.5: Failed Validation - No Lowercase Letter
- Objective: Ensure the system detects passwords without a lowercase letter.
- Input: Enter password: "PASSWORD1!"
- Expected Output: The password should fail the check for at least one uppercase letter.
  Result: "The password must contain at least one uppercase letter"

### Test Case 1.6: Failed Validation - No Special Character
- Objective: Ensure the system detects passwords without a special character.
- Input: Enter password: "Password1"
- Expected Output: The password should fail the check for at least one special character.
  Result: "The password must contain at least one special character"

### Test Case 1.7: Failed Validation - Dangerous Characters
- Objective: Ensure the system detects passwords that contain dangerous characters.
- Input: Enter password: "Password1<>"
- Expected Output: The password should fail the check for dangerous characters.
  Result: "Password contains the following dangerous characters: <, >"
